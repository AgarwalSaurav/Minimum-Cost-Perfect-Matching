# Algorithms for Unweighted and Weighted Perfect Matching Problems in Graphs

I implemented these algorithms during my PhD, in 2011, following the description in:

*Gerards, A.M.H. (1995). Matching. In Ball, M., Magnanti, T., Monma, C., and Nemhauser, G., editors, Network Models, volume 7 of Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, chapter 3, pages 135-224. Elsevier.*

See Example.cpp.
